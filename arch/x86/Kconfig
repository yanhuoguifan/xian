	  This gives the physical address where the kernel is loaded.

	  If kernel is a not relocatable (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=n) then
	  bzImage will decompress itself to above physical address and
	  run from there. Otherwise, bzImage will run from the address where
	  it has been loaded by the boot loader and will ignore above physical
	  address.

	  In normal kdump cases one does not have to set/change this option
	  as now bzImage can be compiled as a completely relocatable image
	  (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y) and be used to load and run from a different
	  address. This option is mainly useful for the folks who don't want
	  to use a bzImage for capturing the crash dump and want to use a
	  vmlinux instead. vmlinux is not relocatable hence a kernel needs
	  to be specifically compiled to run from a specific memory area
	  (normally a reserved region) and this option comes handy.

	  So if you are using bzImage for capturing the crash dump,
	  leave the value here unchanged to 0x1000000 and set
	  CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y.  Otherwise if you plan to use vmlinux
	  for capturing the crash dump change this value to start of
	  the reserved region.  In other words, it can be set based on
	  the "X" value as specified in the "crashkernel=YM@XM"
	  command line boot parameter passed to the panic-ed
	  kernel. Please take a look at Documentation/admin-guide/kdump/kdump.rst
	  for more details about crash dumps.

	  Usage of bzImage for capturing the crash dump is recommended as
	  one does not have to build two kernels. Same kernel can be used
	  as production kernel and capture kernel. Above option should have
	  gone away after relocatable bzImage support is introduced. But it
	  is present because there are users out there who continue to use
	  vmlinux for dump capture. This option should go away down the
	  line.

	  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.
