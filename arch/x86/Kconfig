	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, say N. If you have a system with more
	  than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on uni- and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  uniprocessor machines. On a uniprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  Note that if you say Y here and choose architecture "586" or
	  "Pentium" under "Processor family", the kernel will not work on 486
	  architectures. Similarly, multiprocessor kernels for the "PPro"
	  architecture may not work on all Pentium based boards.

	  People using multiprocessor machines who say Y here should also say
	  Y to "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support", below. The "Advanced Power
	  Management" code will be disabled if you say Y here.

	  See also <file:Documentation/x86/i386/IO-APIC.rst>,
	  <file:Documentation/admin-guide/lockup-watchdogs.rst> and the SMP-HOWTO available at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.
	  
config PHYSICAL_START

	help
	  This gives the physical address where the kernel is loaded.

	  If kernel is a not relocatable (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=n) then
	  bzImage will decompress itself to above physical address and
	  run from there. Otherwise, bzImage will run from the address where
	  it has been loaded by the boot loader and will ignore above physical
	  address.

	  In normal kdump cases one does not have to set/change this option
	  as now bzImage can be compiled as a completely relocatable image
	  (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y) and be used to load and run from a different
	  address. This option is mainly useful for the folks who don't want
	  to use a bzImage for capturing the crash dump and want to use a
	  vmlinux instead. vmlinux is not relocatable hence a kernel needs
	  to be specifically compiled to run from a specific memory area
	  (normally a reserved region) and this option comes handy.

	  So if you are using bzImage for capturing the crash dump,
	  leave the value here unchanged to 0x1000000 and set
	  CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y.  Otherwise if you plan to use vmlinux
	  for capturing the crash dump change this value to start of
	  the reserved region.  In other words, it can be set based on
	  the "X" value as specified in the "crashkernel=YM@XM"
	  command line boot parameter passed to the panic-ed
	  kernel. Please take a look at Documentation/admin-guide/kdump/kdump.rst
	  for more details about crash dumps.

	  Usage of bzImage for capturing the crash dump is recommended as
	  one does not have to build two kernels. Same kernel can be used
	  as production kernel and capture kernel. Above option should have
	  gone away after relocatable bzImage support is introduced. But it
	  is present because there are users out there who continue to use
	  vmlinux for dump capture. This option should go away down the
	  line.

	  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.
