/**
 * BUILD_BUG_ON - break compile if a condition is true.
 * @condition: the condition which the compiler should know is false.
 *
 * If you have some code which relies on certain constants being equal, or
 * other compile-time-evaluated condition, you should use BUILD_BUG_ON to
 * detect if someone changes it.
 *
 * The implementation uses gcc's reluctance to create a negative array, but
 * gcc (as of 4.4) only emits that error for obvious cases (eg. not arguments
 * to inline functions).  So as a fallback we use the optimizer; if it can't
 * prove the condition is false, it will cause a link error on the undefined
 * "__build_bug_on_failed".  This error message can be harder to track down
 * though, hence the two different methods.
